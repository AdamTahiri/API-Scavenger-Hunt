# API Scavenger Hunt

# Part One

API Scavenger Hunt!

For each of the questions below, identify a website and search query that will give you the appropriate JSON. Once you find the API's site, read the docs and use `Insomnia` or `curl` to find the URL that gives you the JSON response you're looking for.

Paste the URL and a snippet of the JSON below. You will edit this very document as part of the assignment.

Put the json between two sets of three backticks. If you want, put the word json right after the first set of three backticks.

It might help you to look at the below section in the non-rendered README view.

Googling the category + API will generally take you to where you need. e.g. "cat fact api".

Example:
- A random cat fact

You write:

https://catfact.ninja/fact

```json
{
  "fact": "The name \"jaguar\" comes from a Native American word meaning \"he who kills with one leap\".",
  "length": 89
}
```

Here are all the APIs to find!

- A list of 150 random users in English.
- All the repos on Github with Pursuit their name
- All the JavaScript repos on Github with Pursuit in their name
- All the Swift repos on Github with Pursuit in their name
- A list of all Pokemon
- A list of all items in Fortnite
- A list of all Game of Thrones Episodes.
- A list of all songs with "Love" in the title.
- All information about Petyr Baelish from the Game of Thrones books
- All the movies Leonardo Dicaprio has acted in

# Part Two

Status Code Scavenger Hunt!

Use Insomnia to find examples of each of the following HTTP codes.

Hint: You may have to tweak your insomnia query to get some of these to happen, or find an API that isn't available without using some authentication. You may also need to google each one to see what it is!

- 200
- 301
- 400
- 401
- 403
- 404
- 418
- 500

For each of the questions below, write:

1. The exact request URL which generated the HTTP status code
2. A description of what the status code means
3. Is there a way to fix your request to get a successful response? If so, how?
